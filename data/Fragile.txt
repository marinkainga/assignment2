Will you let me come closer to you?
I know that you're older, but what can I do?
I leave in the morning, I'll forget that I am surely falling (ah-ah)
Grew up in a case of fragile glass
But hammer away, it's time to crash
And as it shatters, let me shatter into you
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room is spinning
Nerve on my bone
I'm shaking, oh no
I'm talking though, I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've never been so fragile
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ha-ah-ah
It's been a year and 40 days
Since you picked me up and swept me away
I wanted to run with you into the midnight sun with you
Now I sit around and rust in rain
Turn into dust as I just wait
For someone to hold me like you did that night, I still remember
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room kept spinning
'Round, I'm alone
New town, on my own
I'm missing you, I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've never been so fragile
Fragile
