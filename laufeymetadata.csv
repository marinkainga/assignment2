1,Beautiful Stranger,Everything I Know About Love,2022-08-16,"Beautiful stranger, sitting right there
Looked up at me and my dark curly hair
Looked back for a second, didn't want to be rude
I tend to fall in love on the tube
Beautiful stranger, sitting right there
Reading the newspaper, stuck to his chair
I swore that he smiled and I felt my heart drop
Heard the doors open, came to my stop
What if I hadn't left the train
At Ladbroke Grove? Would I know his name?
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairytale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
Beautiful stranger, catching my stare
It's fate we collided right then back there
I wonder if he felt the same thing too
Innocent crush on the morning commute
What if I would've stayed on the train?
Dared to stand up and ask for his name?
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairytale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
My beautiful stranger will have to remain
A love that came and left with this train
My beautiful stranger"
2,Best Friend,Typical of Me,2021-04-30,"It's come to my attention
That I don't show enough
Of what I think
It's only when I drink, I open up
But I promise that I love you
Even with that hairdo
I'm sorry I made fun of it
It's not your fault it looks like shit (like shit)
I have never tolerated someone for so long
I've never laughed so much
I haven't written a sad song
There's no one else I'd rather fall asleep with
And dream with
You're my best friend in the world
When we're ninety-eight and ninety-nine (ninety-nine)
Tumbling down the stairs
You'll barely catch me in time (tumbling down)
We'll argue about what to watch on TV
Finally pick a movie, then we'll fall asleep (asleep)
We'll still be a little bit strange
Some things never change
It's funny 'cause you drive me half insane
A universe without you would be thoroughly mundane
There's no one else I'd rather fall in love with
And that is my best friend in the world
You're my best friend in the world"
3,Bewitched,Bewitched,2023-09-08,"Wrapped me in your arms
Leaned in and whispered
""Keep me in your heart""
I'm so bewildered
What's this new desire called?
I didn't know that much at all 'bout love before
But now, I think I'm learning
You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us, you kissed me good night
You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight
But I'm falling so badly, I'm coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart
And bewitched me
Bewitched me
You're not even gone
I already miss you
What's going on?
I've never been through
This all-consuming fire fuming
Cursing at the moon and losing all control and crying
'Cause I think I'm falling
You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light"
4,Bored,Bewitched: The Goddess Edition,2024-04-26,"Why don't we
Call it for what it is?
Can't remember the last time we kissed
And it tickled my heart
I think that it's best that we spend time apart
I just yawn
Listening to you
Talk about yourself again
And again
I'm bored
Bored of this love
Oh, I'm bored
Bored of this talk
And maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored
Bored
Did you know (did you know)
I wept in my room last night?
Bet you didn't know you make me cry
'Cause you're so self-possessed
Charming at first, but you've made me depressed
So I'm leaving in the morning
'Cause I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this love, oh, I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this talk, and
Maybe you're just way too plain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored (bored)
You followed me out and said, ""Darling, don't leave""
Your passionate monologue woke up the street
""I'll marry you someday, you're perfect for me""
I got in my car just to drown out your plea
'Cause I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this love, oh, I'm bored (bored)
Bored of this talk, and
Maybe you're just way too vain to be interesting
Baby, keep talkin' but nobody's listening
Don't mean to walk out the door
But, baby, I'm bored, oh"
5,Falling Behind,Everything I Know About Love,2022-08-26,"Moved out to a new city
June is dawning down on me
And all that I can find
A sickly romance in the air
Lovers stroll without a care in sight
Ooh, this can't be right
'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
Touched the ocean, fell right in
Stepped outside and burned my skin
My life won't go my way
Bossa nova in my room
Hope that I'll find someone too to love
Because
The sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love, oh
Everybody's falling in love but me
(One, two, three)"
6,Fragile,Everything I Know About Love,2022-08-26,"Will you let me come closer to you?
I know that you're older, but what can I do?
I leave in the morning, I'll forget that I am surely falling (ah-ah)
Grew up in a case of fragile glass
But hammer away, it's time to crash
And as it shatters, let me shatter into you
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room is spinning
Nerve on my bone
I'm shaking, oh no
I'm talking though, I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've never been so fragile
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ha-ah-ah
It's been a year and 40 days
Since you picked me up and swept me away
I wanted to run with you into the midnight sun with you
Now I sit around and rust in rain
Turn into dust as I just wait
For someone to hold me like you did that night, I still remember
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room kept spinning
'Round, I'm alone
New town, on my own
I'm missing you, I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I've never been so fragile
Fragile"
7,From The Start,Bewitched,2023-09-08,"Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
""She's so perfect, "" blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start"
8,Goddess,Bewitched: The Goddess Edition,2024-04-26,"It always goes like this
Could've predicted it
I'm so naive to think you loved me for me
Kissed as I ran off stage
Too old to play this game
Guess you're still growing up at thirty
Oh
Were you surprised by me
When you took me home?
When the glamor wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone
You took a star to bed
Woke up with me instead
You must have felt so damn deceived
When you made up a version of
Me that you thought you'd love
But I am not your Aphrodite
Oh
Were you surprised by me
When you took me home?
When the glamor wore off
Reduced to skin and bone
I can't even tell
Who you want to know
I'm a goddess on stage
Human when we're alone
You took me for a fool
You stole my youth
You wanted this so much
You watched me rise
Then killed my light
And now you know
I'm not your fucking goddess
Oh, oh
I'm no goddess when I'm alone"
9,I Wish You Love,Typical of Me,2021-04-30,"I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
I wish you love, love
Love, love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So, with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love"
10,Like The Movies,Typical of Me,2021-04-30,"Maybe one day, I'll fall in a bookstore
Into the arms of a guy
We'll sneak into bars, and gaze at the stars
Surrounded by fireflies
Oh, I'd like to sleep in 'til two on a Sunday
And listen to the bluebirds sigh
Get soaked in the rain and smile through the pain
Slow dance under stormy skies
Maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love
Oh, maybe I'm just old fashioned
Read too many fairytales
It's no wonder I've had no luck, no one's ever good enough
I want a love like I've seen in the movies
That's why I'll never fall in love"
11,Lovesick,Bewitched,2023-09-08,"Floorboards creaking in my home
Deathly silence when alone
Oh, I wish that you were here right now
So unlike me, somehow I
Fell in love in just three nights
Those November days still haunting me
When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
In the morning, you would be gone
I'd be mourning, tryin' to hold on to the memory of your lips
God, I'm so lovesick, what have you done to me?
Let me in your atmosphere
Inching closer, but I fear
That I'll love so much, you'll slip away (mm, mm-mm)
Getting twisted in my head
Dreams are nightmares in my bed
Since the last night that I spent with you
When the gold rays fell on your skin
And my hair got caught in the wind
The choir sang a melancholic hymn (ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
In the morning, you're not in my bed
I'll just sleep until I fall dead to the memory of your lips
God, I'm so lovesick
What have you done to me? (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)"
12,Magnolia,Typical of Me,2021-04-30,"Magnolia, she could have anyone in the world
Floats around town in a golden gown
Born in a castle on a cloud
Magnolia, prettiest girl that I know
Stars in her eyes, handpicked from the skies
Beautiful soul
How can I compete with her?
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia
Ooh
Oh
Magnolia, she can move oceans and rivers with ease
A word from her lips, her sirens kiss
Will send you straight into abyss
Magnolia, I wish she'd give her secrets away
Enchants everyone and I think it'd be fun
To be like her someday
But I cannot compete with her
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia
Magnolia"
13,Promise,Bewitched,2023-09-08,"I made a promise
To distance myself
Took a flight, through aurora skies
Honestly, I didn't think about
How we didn't say goodbye
Just see you very soon
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
So I didn't call you
For sixteen long days
And I should get a cigarette
For so much restraint
No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you
I've done the math
There's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?
So I broke my promise
I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
If it weren't for the sight of a boy
Who looked just like you
Standing out on Melrose Avenue
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you"
14,Valentine,Everything I Know About Love,2022-08-26,"I've rejected affection
For years and years
Now I have it, and damn it
It's kind of weird
He tells me I'm pretty
Don't know how to respond
I tell him that he's pretty too
Can I say that? Don't have a clue
With every passing moment
I surprise myself
I'm scared of flies
I'm scared of guys
Someone please help
'Cause I think I've fallen
In love this time
I blinked and suddenly, I had a valentine
(Valentine)
What if he's the last one I kiss?
What if he's the only one I'll ever miss?
Maybe I should run, I'm only 21
I don't even know who I want to become
I've lost all control of my heartbeat now
Got caught in a romance with him somehow
I still feel a shock through every bone
When I hear an ""I love you""
'Cause now I've got someone to lose
The first one to ever like me back
I'm seconds away from a heart attack
How the hell did I fall in love this time?
And honestly, I can't believe I get to call you mine
I blinked and suddenly, I had a valentine
(Valentine)"
