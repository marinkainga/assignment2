Moved out to a new city
June is dawning down on me
And all that I can find
A sickly romance in the air
Lovers stroll without a care in sight
Ooh, this can't be right
'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
Touched the ocean, fell right in
Stepped outside and burned my skin
My life won't go my way
Bossa nova in my room
Hope that I'll find someone too to love
Because
The sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friend's found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind
Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love, oh
Everybody's falling in love but me
(One, two, three)
