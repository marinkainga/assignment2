Magnolia, she could have anyone in the world
Floats around town in a golden gown
Born in a castle on a cloud
Magnolia, prettiest girl that I know
Stars in her eyes, handpicked from the skies
Beautiful soul
How can I compete with her?
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia
Ooh
Oh
Magnolia, she can move oceans and rivers with ease
A word from her lips, her sirens kiss
Will send you straight into abyss
Magnolia, I wish she'd give her secrets away
Enchants everyone and I think it'd be fun
To be like her someday
But I cannot compete with her
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia
Magnolia
